# Welcome to Salad

Salad makes it easy to earn rewards by sharing your computer's idle resources. Use your extra GPU, CPU, and internet
bandwidth processing power to run jobs and earn Salad Balance in return. You can redeem your Salad Balance for PayPal,
gift cards, games, subscriptions, and more.

This Quickstart guide will walk you through the steps to get started with Salad, from downloading the application to
configuring your settings and earning your first rewards.

## Step 1: Download Salad

To get started, make sure your PC meets the
[minimum system requirements](/docs/faq/compatibility/is-my-machine-compatible-with-salad) and then
[download the Salad application](https://salad.com/download). It may take a few minutes to download, depending on your
internet speed.

Once downloaded, run the installer and follow the prompts to install Salad on your machine. Once running, you can find
the Salad App in your system tray.

## Step 2: Create an Account

If you don't already have a Salad account, you'll need to create one. Open the Salad application and click on "Log In".
This will open up your web browser and prompt you to enter your email address to create an account. You'll be sent a
one-time login code to that email address. Enter the code in the Salad application to log in. You can also sign up using
Google SSO.

Once registered, the app will automatically log you in and start machine onboarding.

## Step 3: Setup Your Machine

After logging in, Salad will guide you through the machine setup process. This includes:

- **Whitelisting Salad in your Antivirus Software**: To ensure Salad runs smoothly, you may need to whitelist it in your
  antivirus software. Follow the instructions provided in the app to do this.
- **Installing WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)**: Salad uses [WSL](/docs/faq/jobs/what-is-wsl) to run jobs on your
  machine. If you don't have WSL installed, the app will guide you through the installation process.
- **Configuring Settings**: You can customize your Salad experience by adjusting what workloads you're opted in to run.
  You can adjust this later in [Settings](/docs/guides/using-salad/salad-app-settings).

Once your machine is set up, start Salad by selecting "Chop Now" from the main dashboard. Salad will begin searching for
Jobs to run on your machine. Salad is designed to run whilst you're AFK, so make sure to close any other heavy
applications or games.

## Step 4: Redeem a Reward

Once you have enough Salad Balance, you can redeem it for rewards. To do this, click your profile icon at the top left
of the Salad App and select 'Store'. Your browser will open to the [Salad Storefront](https://salad.com/store) where you
can browse available rewards and redeem your Salad Balance. Once redeemed, you can find it in your
[Reward Vault](/docs/guides/using-salad/where-to-find-your-reward-redemption-code) and in your email.
