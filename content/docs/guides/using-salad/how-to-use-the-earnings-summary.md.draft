_Last Updated September 10, 2025_

The Earnings Summary allows you to see how much you've earned in total, track your current earning rates per machine,
and view your historical earnings in either a table, or a graph. You can also view how long you've Chopped for total, as
well as the total number of rewards you've redeemed.
