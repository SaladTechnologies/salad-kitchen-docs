title: Salad App Passkeys
---

As the Salad network expands into more profitable jobs, we've introduced Passkeys to enhance the security of Chef
accounts. Passkeys work differently from passwords or one-time authentication codes. Instead, they use authentication
for your device, often biometrics or unlock pins. Chefs must manually add Passkeys within the Salad app.

**To set up Passkeys, follow these steps:**

1. Navigate to the [Salad web app](https://salad.com/account/summary) and scroll down to the **Account Security**
   section.
2. Under **Account Security**, click on the **Add a passkey** option.

3. Complete the OTP challenge that appears.
4. If successful, you'll see that a Passkey has been added for your browser.
