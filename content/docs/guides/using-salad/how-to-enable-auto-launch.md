_Last Updated: 23rd October 2025_

Keeping Auto Launch enabled allows Salad to start-up when your PC boots. Enabling this along with
[Auto Start](/docs/guides/using-salad/how-to-enable-auto-start) will allow Salad to start Chopping automatically
whenever you go AFK from your PC. By default this option is **enabled**, however you can turn it off.

1. Open your Salad Widget
