---

Chefs with multiple PCs on their account are now able to breakdown earnings per machine. This feature can be toggled on
or off on the [Earning Summary Page](/docs/guides/using-salad/129-how-to-see-your-earnings-history). Chefs can list up
to 20 machines on the histogram.

Chefs may find unknown Machine IDs listed. This can happen if one of the Chefs machines is on an older version of Salad
or after hardware changes.
