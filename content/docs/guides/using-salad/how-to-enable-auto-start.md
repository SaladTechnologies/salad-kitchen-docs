To ensure that the Salad App starts automatically when you go idle from your PC, you'll need to configure Auto Start in
the Salad App settings. This will allow you to start earning Salad Balance automatically when you go away from your PC.

1. Open the Salad App

3. Scroll down to 'Auto Start'
4. Drag the slider to the desired number of minutes before the Salad App starts automatically. The shorter the time, the
   quicker you'll start earning Salad Balance when you go idle.

We detect idleness based on your mouse and keyboard activity, so if you regularly have short periods of inactivity where
you don't want to start Chopping, consider setting a slightly longer time for Auto Start. Moving your mouse or using
your keyboard will reset this timer.
