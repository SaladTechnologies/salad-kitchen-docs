# How to Enable Compute Mode on AMD Drivers

If you are using an AMD Graphics card from the RX 400/500 series, we advise that you enable Compute Mode in your AMD
Radeon Settings, or you may suffer extremely reduced earnings. We advise turning this back to Graphics mode when
intended to game, or you may see slightly reduced FPS in some titles.

These GPUs require Compute Mode to be enabled

- RX 470
- RX 480
- RX 570
- RX 580
- RX 590

To enable this feature, you will need to ensure you are updated to the most Recent AMD Drivers. If you are on older
drivers, you can follow our guide here to
[update your drivers](https://support.salad.io/hc/en-us/articles/360035633852-How-to-update-my-AMD-Drivers). It is also
important to make sure toÂ **Turn Off Salad Before Starting.**
