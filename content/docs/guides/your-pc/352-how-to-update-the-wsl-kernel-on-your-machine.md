It looks like you have experienced an error that will require you to re-install the WSL kernel on your machine. Follow
these steps to resolve it.

1. Open Powershell as an Administrator:
   1. Click on the start menu and search for **Windows Powershell** or **Command Prompt**. Be sure to click _Run as
      Administrator_ on the window.

2. Run the update command:
   1. Type `wsl --update` into the open Powershell window and hit enter to update the WSL kernel.

Once WSL has been updated the Degraded notification should go away. If you continue to see the notification, take a
screen shot, and reach out to [Salad Support](/docs/Guides/Your-PC/216-how-to-create-a-support-ticket).
