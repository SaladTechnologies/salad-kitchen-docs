## Salad Ticket Requirements

Help us help you, Chef! Make sure you include your Salad account email address and your CPU/GPU model info on every
ticket.

1. Navigate to [https://support.salad.com](https://support.salad.com) or any page on
   [https://salad.com/store](https://salad.com/store).

3. Let us know what your issue is, and hit the "Send a message" button to submit your ticket.

If you are unable to access this page, or cannot see the "Contact Us" option, you can instead send us an email to
[support@salad.com](mailto:support@salad.com?subject=I%20need%20help%20with%20Salad%21&body=Hi%20there%21%20I%20need%20help%20with..).

Simply click the email address, and it'll pop open your default mail client ready to send us an email! Alternatively you
can enter it as the "To" address in your favorite mail service. _You will need to make sure you submit your ticket from
the same email address that's connected to your Salad account, or we may not be able to provide assistance on some
issues in order to keep your account secure._

If you need to upload log files to your ticket, you can do so by following these instructions:
[How to find your Salad log files](/docs/guides/using-salad/180-how-to-find-your-salad-log-files).

You can view your active, and past tickets and chats within the widget by selecting "previous conversations" on the main
menu if available. You can also reply to your support tickets through here as well.
