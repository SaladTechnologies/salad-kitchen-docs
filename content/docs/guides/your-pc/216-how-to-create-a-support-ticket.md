3. If you are on the Salad Webapp, click the "Contact Us" page at the top. Alternatively, you can try looking for direct

   directly to the contact page

5. Let us know what your issue is, and hit the "Send a message" button to submit your ticket.
6. If you are unable to access this page, or cannot see the "Contact Us" option, you can instead send us an email to
   [support@salad.com](mailto:support@salad.com?subject=I%20need%20help%20with%20Salad%21&body=Hi%20there%21%20I%20need%20help%20with..).
   Simply click the email address, and it'll pop open your default mail client ready to send us an email! Alternatively
   you can enter it as the "To" address in your favourite mail service. _You will need to make sure you submit your
   ticket from the same email address that's connected to your Salad account, or we may not be able to provide
   assistance on some issues in order to keep your account secure._

If you need to upload log files to your ticket, you can do so by following these instructions:
[How to find your Salad log files](https://support.salad.com/article/180-how-to-find-your-salad-log-files)

You can view your active, and past tickets and chats within the widget by selecting "previous conversations" on the main
menu if available. You can also reply to your support tickets through here as well.
