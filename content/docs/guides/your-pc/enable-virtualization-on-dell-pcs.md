---

_Last Updated: 23rd October 2025_

Many commercially available PCs allow users to manage their BIOS configuration directly from the startup screen. These
step-by-step guides will help you access and adjust the BIOS settings on prebuilt PCs manufactured by Dell.

If you don't know what kind of CPU you have, please see
[Identifying Your CPU](/docs/guides/your-pc/identifying-your-cpu).

## Accessing BIOS Setup

1. Restart or boot your computer.
2. When the Dell logo appears, press the **F2** key to enter the BIOS Setup Utility.
3. Using the arrow keys, navigate to the **Advanced** tab. _(Some systems feature a separate **Virtualization Support**
   menu. If yours does, please choose this tab instead.)_
4. Select **Virtualization** from the menu.
5. Enable **Virtualization** and **Virtualization for Direct-IO** (or **VT-d**, on Intel systems).
6. Save your configuration and exit.
