title: How to Enable or Disable Auto Launch
---

Keeping Auto Launch enabled allows Salad to start-up when your PC boots. Enabling this along with
[Auto Start](/docs/Guides/Using-the-Salad-App/How-to-Enable-Auto-Start) will allow Salad to start Chopping automatically
whenever you go AFK from your PC. By default this option is **enabled**, however you can turn it off.
