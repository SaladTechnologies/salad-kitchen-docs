The first step in your Salad journey is to download the Salad application. To run Salad, you will need a
[Windows 10 or Windows 11](/docs/faq/compatibility/72-do-you-support-macos-and-linux) PC. Additional information on the
minimum and recommended system requirements can be found

You can download Salad from either our [official website](https://www.salad.com/download) or from our official
