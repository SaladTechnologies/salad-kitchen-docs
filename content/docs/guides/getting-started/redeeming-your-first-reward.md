title: 'Redeeming your First Reward'
---

_Last Updated September 8, 2025_

Now that you've earned some Salad Balance, it's time to redeem your first reward from the storefront! To get started,
open up your web browser and head to the [Salad Storefront](https://salad.com/store). From here, you can browse through
the wide variety of rewards available, including gift cards, game codes, subscriptions, and even PayPal and Prepaid
Visa/Mastercards.

We recommend looking for something cheaper for your first redemption, as you may not have enough Salad Balance yet for
some of the higher-priced items. For example, you could purchase a
[$1 Amazon Gift Card](https://salad.com/store/search?q=amazon%20gift%20card&size=n_20_n&filters%5B0%5D%5Bfield%5D=price&filters%5B0%5D%5Bvalues%5D%5B0%5D%5Bto%5D=n_5_n&filters%5B0%5D%5Bvalues%5D%5B0%5D%5Bfrom%5D=n_1_n&filters%5B0%5D%5Bvalues%5D%5B0%5D%5Bname%5D=%241%20to%20%245&filters%5B0%5D%5Btype%5D=all)
or a [donation to your favorite charity](https://salad.com/store/search?q=Donation&size=n_20_n).
