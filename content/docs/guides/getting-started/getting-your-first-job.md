Now that you've [downloaded Salad](/docs/Guides/Getting-Started/Downloading-Salad),
[registered your account](/docs/Guides/Getting-Started/133-how-to-register-and-log-into-salad), and
[set up the application](/docs/Guides/Getting-Started/Setting-up-the-Salad-App), you're ready to get your first job and
starting Chopping Salad Balance!

To get started, open the Salad application from your System Tray, and select 'Chop Now' from the dropdown options in the
centre of the app. Salad will take a few minutes to configure itself, and then it will start searching for available
jobs. If you've got [in-demand hardware](/docs/FAQ/Community/613-network-monitor), or are eligible for
[Bandwidth Sharing](/docs/FAQ/Jobs/253-what-is-bandwidth-sharing) Jobs, you should receive your first job within a few
minutes. It will take a little while to download it, depending on your
[internet speeds](/docs/Guides/Your-PC/619-improve-internet-speed-Container-Jobs).

Once downloaded, it will start running, and you should start to earn Salad Balance within 5-15 minutes. Don't worry if
it takes a little bit longer, it may still be starting up. Leave it to run for a few hours, and you should have earned
enough Salad Balance to [redeem your first reward](/docs/Guides/Getting-Started/Redeeming-your-First-Reward)!
