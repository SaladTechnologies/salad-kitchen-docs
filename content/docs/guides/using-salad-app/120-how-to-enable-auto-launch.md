# How to Enable or Disable Auto Launch

Keeping Auto Launch enabled allows Salad to start-up when your PC boots. Enabling this along with [Auto Start](https://support.salad.com/article/119-how-to-enable-auto-start-in-salad) will allow Salad to start Chopping automatically whenever you go AFK from your PC. By default this option is **enabled**, however you can turn it off.

1. Open your Salad Widget
