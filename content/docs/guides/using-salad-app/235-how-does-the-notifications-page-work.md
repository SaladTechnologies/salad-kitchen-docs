# Using the Notifications Page

The notifications page contains all the notifications, errors, or messages you have received. If you run into an issue whilst running Salad, we'll send a notification to your desktop, as well as the "EARN" page of your Salad widget. Clicking into the notification, or navigating to the Notifications page, will show more details about the received notification, as well as actions to take. This could include links to view a guide on how to resolve an issue, or buttons to try re-running certain jobs.Â

The notifications page can be accessed by:
