title: 'Getting Cryptomining Jobs'

_Last Updated: 23rd October 2025_

Salad offers a variety of job types, including Cryptomining Jobs. These Jobs are automatically offered as a backup
option when no other Jobs are available for your machine so you can keep earning Salad Balance. These Jobs typically
have a lower payout rate than other Jobs, but they can still be profitable depending on your hardware and electricity
costs.
