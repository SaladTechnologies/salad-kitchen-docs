_Last Updated September 11, 2025_

You can automate when Salad will start, and stop, Chopping with our Schedule Chopping feature. You should set this up
for when you know you're not at your PC, to ensure you're earning as much Salad Balance as possible.

1. Open the Salad App and open up settings from your profile icon in the top left corner.
2. From there, scroll down to the 'Workload Preferences section'.
3. Then, Scroll down again to 'Advanced Options'.
4. At the top of the page, you can see the Schedule Chopping settings. Start by turning it on with the toggle switch.
5. Then, for each day of the week, you'll see a square for each hour. You can toggle each square between Paused,
   No-Mining, and Auto-Start.
   - Paused means Salad will not run during these hours.
   - No-Mining means Salad will run any job during these hours, except
     [Cryptomining Jobs](/docs/Guides/Getting-Jobs/Getting-Cryptomining-Jobs).
   - Auto-Start means Salad will start Chopping any available job during these hours.

You can adjust your settings at any time if you need to dial it in, or if your PC usage changes.
