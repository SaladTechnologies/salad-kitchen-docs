##### I enabled Bandwidth sharing, but I don't see any earnings.

- You may not have sufficient internet speed. If there are users with higher speeds ahead of you in the queue they will
  get workloads first. Bandwidth jobs are dependent on the needs of the network and jobs will be assigned to users with
  the highest speeds available.
- WorkaroundsÂ Â 
  - Keep chopping chef! A spot is likely to open up in time. Remember that Bandwidth Sharing is based on the
    availability of Bandwidth workloads and it's normal to go a little while in between jobs.
  - Minimize other traffic on your connection. This might increase your speed and put you higher in the queue for jobs.
  - You can try turning your router off, waiting two minutes and then turning it back on again. This will typically
    assign a new IP address to you. It might be helpful if, for whatever reason, your ISP flagged your old IP address.
    The new IP address should be fresh, and wonâ€™t have the ISP block.

**Can I earn XP while running Bandwidth workloads?**Â 

- Yes! Bandwidth sharing will earn Salad chefs XP.
