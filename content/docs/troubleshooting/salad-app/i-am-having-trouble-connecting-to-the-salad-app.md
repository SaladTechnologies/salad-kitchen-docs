title: Troubleshooting Salad App Connection Issues
---

Warning!

- Salad does not offer support for Chefs running Salad in Virtual Machines (VMWare, VirtualBox, Proxmox, etc), which can
  cause Salad to stop working properly - our support team will not help investigate issues.
- Most Remote Desktops relying on RDP will cause the above issue - please uninstall these from your system and reinstall
  Salad should you encounter this issue.

## Use a Supported Web Browser

Ensure that the web browser you're using is supported by Salad. Some supported browsers include:

- [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/)
- [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge)
- [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.firefox.com/)

Some browsers have protection settings enabled which conflict with Salad, some popular examples include:

- Brave Browser
- Safari

These, along with other privacy-centric browsers may pose similar problems.

### Selecting a Supported Web Browser

1. Find your Salad Widget in the System Tray or Overflow Tray

2. Click the Salad Widget icon and open the Salad Widget Menu at the top left

3. Click 'Account' within the Salad Widget Menu, you should be redirected to the Salad Account Summary web browser page,
   within your default web browser.

4. From here, you have two options:
   1. If your device's default web browser is unsupported by Salad, simply copy and paste the URL above into a supported
      web browser, such as Google Chrome, Firefox, or Microsoft Edge.
   2. You can also temporarily, or permanently, change your device's default web browser to a supported web browser.
      This will change where the Salad Account URL redirects to by default. Here's more on how to change your default
      web browser:
