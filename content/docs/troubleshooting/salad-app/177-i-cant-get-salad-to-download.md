title: I Can't Get Salad to Download
---

_Last Updated: 23rd October 2025_

Just like any application, sometimes you may run into a few obstacles when downloading Salad. These steps should solve
the most common issues:

1. If you're using Chrome, you may need to manually allow the download from the Download Manager at the top right.
   Chrome frequently blocks downloads of .exe or .msi files.
2. [Clear your cache](https://www.wikihow.com/Clear-Cache-and-Cookies), sometimes data can be corrupted and you need to
   clear it to continue.
3. Try the download in a different browser if you have one installed.
4. Check whether your
   [antivirus is blocking the program](https://smallbusiness.chron.com/install-program-avast-blocks-80037.html).

If none of these solutions work, please reach out to
[Salad Support](/docs/guides/your-pc/216-how-to-create-a-support-ticket) and we'll work to resolve your problem ASAP.
