# Troubleshooting Salad App Connection Issues

Warning!

- Salad does not offer support for Chefs running Salad in Virtual Machines (VMWare, VirtualBox, Proxmox, etc), which can cause Salad to stop working properly - our support team will not help investigate issues.
- Most Remote Desktops relying on RDP will cause the above issue - please uninstall these from your system and reinstall Salad should you encounter this issue.

## Use a Supported Web Browser

Ensure that the web browser you're using is supported by Salad. Some supported browsers include:

- [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/)
- [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge)
- [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.firefox.com/)

Some browsers have protection settings enabled which conflict with Salad, some popular examples include:

- Brave Browser
- Safari

These, along with other privacy-centric browsers may pose similar problems.

### Selecting a Supported Web Browser

1. Find your Salad Widget in the System Tray or Overflow Tray

4. From here, you have two options:
   
   1. If your device's default web browser is unsupported by Salad, simply copy and paste the URL above into a supported web browser, such as Google Chrome, Firefox, or Microsoft Edge.
   2. You can also temporarily, or permanently, change your device's default web browser to a supported web browser. This will change where the Salad Account URL redirects to by default. Here's more on how to change your default web browser:
