# Unable to Start Salad with Docker Installed

Your Docker settings might be interfering with Salad Container workloads. If you are not running Docker on your PC, the problem might originate with your NVIDIA drivers. [Update your drivers](https://support.salad.com/article/174-how-to-update-my-nvidia-drivers) and reboot your machine if Resource Saver does not resolve the error.

### Disable Docker Resource Saver

1. Open Docker Desktop.
2. Open Settings and locate Resource Saver.
3. Disable Resource Saver.
