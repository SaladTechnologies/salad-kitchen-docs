title: Unable to Start Salad with Docker Installed
---

Your Docker settings might be interfering with Salad Container workloads. If you are not running Docker on your PC, the
problem might originate with your NVIDIA drivers.
[Update your drivers](/docs/guides/your-pc/174-how-to-update-my-nvidia-drivers) and reboot your machine if Resource
Saver does not resolve the error.

### Disable Docker Resource Saver

1. Open Docker Desktop.
2. Open Settings and locate Resource Saver.
3. Disable Resource Saver.
