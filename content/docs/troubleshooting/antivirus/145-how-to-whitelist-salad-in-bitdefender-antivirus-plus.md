**6. Adding Salad as an Exception**

**Salad 1.0.0. and Later:** After you have clicked "Add an Exception" you will be shown a dialogue box. In that dialogue
box you'll want to navigate to the Salad Miners folder and select it, the filepath for this is
"C:\\ProgramData\\Salad\\workloads" (without the quotations). Make sure to enable Antivirus protection for all 3
settings, as well as Online Threat Prevention.

whitelist page with your newly added exception.

Head back to the "Protection" page, and this time head into the "Online Threat Prevention" tab.

**10. Run Salad to download the miners**

Start Salad, and wait for it to reach the Chopping state. Once the Chopping state is reached, you can stop Salad.

Go back the the page shown in the last few steps of the guide, and now you can re-enable your "Web attack prevention"
setting, allowing it to continue protecting you.

**12. Salad should now be whitelisted correctly**

Open your Salad widget, and click the play button. Contact support
