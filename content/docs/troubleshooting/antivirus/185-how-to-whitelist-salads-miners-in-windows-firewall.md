5. Click Change settings at the top right, and click all the checkboxes on the right side, as well as left side, of the affected miner. Do the same for any further firewall-blocked affected miners, if you see the same item listed multiple times, make sure to allow all of them through. Then click OK.

**Please note:Â If you are using another Firewall service, please consult their website or support for details on how to allow applications or services through your Firewall.**
