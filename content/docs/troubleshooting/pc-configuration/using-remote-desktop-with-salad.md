title: 'Using Remote Desktop with Salad'

Salad is incompatible with any Remote Desktop solutions that utilize Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). This includes, but
is not limited to:

- Windows Remote Desktop Connection
- Microsoft Remote Desktop (Mac)
- Any other third-party RDP-based Remote Desktop solutions

Using any of these applications while running Salad will prevent Salad from functioning correctly, as they interfere
with [WSL](/docs/faq/jobs/what-is-wsl).

## **What can I use Instead?**

If you need to access your machine remotely while running Salad, we recommend using a non-RDP-based Remote Desktop
solution, such as:

- TeamViewer
- AnyDesk
- Chrome Remote Desktop
- Parsec
