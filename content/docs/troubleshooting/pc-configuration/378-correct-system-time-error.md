# Correct System Time Error

Some Chefs may experience issues with Salad workloads if their PC clock is set to the wrong time. Chefs should confirm that their PC is set to automatically update the time and date. If that does not resolve the issue, check that your PC is synchronized properly to your internet time server.

**Set Time Automatically in Windows**

1. Right click on the date/time widget in your PCs taskbar and select ***Adjust date and time***.
