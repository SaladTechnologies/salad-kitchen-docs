title: Salad Sounds Too Good to be True. What's the Catch?

_Last Updated: 23rd October 2025_

While we offer high value rewards and an easy way to monetize your idle processing power, there are some definite
limitations to Salad right now. We want to be as transparent about these limitations as possible, so our users can make
an informed decision about choosing Salad.

- The first, and biggest, issue for Salad is the profitability of container workloads and cryptocurrency mining rates
  vs. the electricity cost to run your GPU.
- Be sure to [check your local electricity rates](http://powertochoose.org/) against your earnings in Salad. While the
  profit may be slight, remember that mining is only one of three workloads we have available. Luckily, electricity cost
  is not nearly as detrimental to [Container workload](https://salad.com/blog/container-workloads/) earnings on the
  network.
- We also try to offset this with discount rewards in the carousel that inflate the value of your earnings.

However, Distributed Computing isn't a cure-all. While running these tasks usually net significantly more in earnings
for users, they aren't always available. Each job runs for a set amount of time, and might not require the entire
user-base to run its course. We imagine it would be exceedingly frustrating to run Salad and not get any jobs during
that time frame, that's why we also offer [Cryptocurrency](/docs/faq/salad-app/what-miners-does-salad-currently-use)
mining to establish a base earning rate and ensure that so long as you're chopping Salad, you're making money.

While no workloads are currently running, Salad will make its best effort to consume little energy, ensuring that your
electricity costs remain low while no earnings are being made on the app.
