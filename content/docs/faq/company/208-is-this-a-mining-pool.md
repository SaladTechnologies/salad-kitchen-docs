title: Is Salad a Mining Pool?
---

No, Salad is not itself a mining pool. Instead, we leverage multiple third-party mining pools to maximize your earnings
for [Mining workloads](/docs/faq/salad-app/80-what-miners-does-salad-currently-use). We currently use:

- Nicehash
- Prohashing

Building on existing mining pools helps us streamline the mining process to deliver tangible rewards without users
having to worry about pools, servers, wallets, etc.
