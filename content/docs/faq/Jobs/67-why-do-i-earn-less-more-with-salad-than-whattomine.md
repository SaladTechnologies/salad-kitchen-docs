title: Why Do I Earn Less/More Mining With Salad Than WhatToMine?
---

The 'Earning Rates' given by sites like WhatToMine or Nicehash are guesstimates, anything as inherently random as
cryptomining will never yield constant flat rates. Furthermore, their estimates are based on the “best possible
circumstances,” meaning that they reflect the _maximum_ that a give GPU _could_ earn, if certain conditions are met,
such as:

- Your GPU performing optimally.
- Winning the
  [Silicon Lottery.](https://www.nicehash.com/blog/post/what-is-a-silicon-lottery-and-how-does-affect-mining)
- Not using the GPU for anything else.
- Mining 24 hours/day, 7 days/week.
- Achieving [100% luck rates](https://2miners.com/blog/mining-mining-luck/).

Salad also offers more workloads than just Mining, we also offer Containerized Compute jobs, and Bandwidth sharing.
