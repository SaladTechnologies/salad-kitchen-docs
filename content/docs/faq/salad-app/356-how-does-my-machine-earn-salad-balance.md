title: How Does my Machine Earn Salad balance?
---

_Last Updated: 23rd October 2025_

Salad offers a range of opportunities to earn rewards. There are three primary types of workloads available: Container
Workloads, Bandwidth sharing, and Mining. Each of these workloads has its unique benefits and requirements, catering to
different preferences and resources. Read on to discover how you can maximize your earnings with Salad.

## Container Jobs

Container workloads allow Chefs to share their idle compute power to work containerized processes like the latest Stable
Diffusion and Speech-To-Text transcription for SaladCloud customers. Containers must be downloaded onto your machine
before they can run, which requires a stable internet connection and enough storage for the container. Not sure if
you're machine is set up to work these jobs? Check out the [Chopping Power](/docs/guides/using-salad/333-chopping-power)
bar in the Salad app.

Container payouts will vary by the day, hour and week. These jobs are not as consistent as Mining workloads, but they
are usually much more profitable.

## Bandwidth

Chefs in
[eligible regions](/docs/troubleshooting/bandwidth-sharing-jobs/295-bandwidth-sharing-quick-troubleshooting-guide) can
share their excess bandwidth in exchange for Salad balance. These workloads pay out right away, and show up in your
Earnings History. Additionally, this workload does not require any special type of hardware, you just need to reach the
minimum network speed requirements. This can vary, but usually requires a minimum of 15 megabits per second of upload
and download, and less than 100ms of latency.

Bandwidth sharing can run with Container and Mining workloads at the same time. It's a great way to maximize your
earnings!

## Mining

Salad's fall back workload is crypto mining. We use safe, trusted crypto miners and pay out shares roughly every fifteen
minutes. Mining workloads will run on most Chef machines, including AMD and Intel Dedicated GPUs which are not eligible
for Container workloads.
