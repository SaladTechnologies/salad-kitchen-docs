title: Can I Adjust how much of my GPU is Used?
---

Unfortunately at this time, we are not able to support adjusting usage of your CPU or GPU hardware. This is because the
jobs that you run require the full power of the hardware they requested - for example a 3060Ti, and we are not currently
able to provide split performance.

In the same way, CPU and RAM requirements are bound by the client's needs, though your machine will only use up to 70%
of the RAM available on your machine.
