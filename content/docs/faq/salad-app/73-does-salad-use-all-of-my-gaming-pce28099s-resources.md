title: Does Salad use all of my PC's Resources?
---

Salad may use all of your PCs resources whilst running, depending on the job you're currently working.

## Does Salad use all of my GPU?

For GPU Container Workloads and mining, Salad will fully utilize your Graphics Card (GPU) while running. This means that
applications which rely on your GPU won't be able to be run. This includes gaming, media applications, and (of course)
GPU cryptomining. However, some programs do not need your GPU to function, like basic web browsing and writing text
documents. These applications should run fine while Salad chops away in the background.

Note that while running intensive apps alongside Salad, the app may temporarily block workloads from running on your
machine to ensure the health of the network. This includes games, rendering apps, or other intensive processes, and you
will have to close the intensive app before starting to Chop again in order to remove the workload block.

## Does Salad use all of my CPU?

Salad does not use your Central Processing Unit (CPU) for mining, but it is utilized for CPU Container workloads. CPU
Containers can often be light weight, and not interfere with gaming or media like Netflix. CPU Containers can usually
run safely in the background while you do most tasks on your PC.

## Does Salad use all of my internet?

If you're choosing to Bandwidth Share, whilst Chopping Salad may use a significant portion of your available network
bandwidth. If you're having trouble using the internet, we recommend stopping Salad to do so.
