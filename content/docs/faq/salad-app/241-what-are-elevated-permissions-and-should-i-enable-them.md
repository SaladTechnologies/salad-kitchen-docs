title: What are Elevated Permissions and Should I Enable Them?
---

# What are Elevated permissions?

Enabling Elevated Permissions in your Salad app allows us to run some windows-native workloads as "Admin". Enabling this
setting may allow us to run certain workloads with increased earnings. If enabled, we'll only run workloads as Admin
when needed, or if it's going to increase your earnings. You can enable this feature in the
[Settings page](/docs/guides/using-the-salad-app/353-salad-app-settings) of your Salad app.

# Should I enable them?

If you run Salad with with older RX 400-500 AMD GPU enabled, we do recommend enabling Elevated Permissions. It also
allows us to automatically enable certain driver settings to boost your earnings by a significant amount. It's also
possible we may add more workloads in the future that rely on Elevated Permissions, so even if you don't have an AMD GPU
we still recommend enabling it if required to allow Salad to always run the most profitable workload for your machine.

# What are the risks, if any?

It is possible that a workload run with Elevated Permissions may run into an unexpected bug or issue that could cause
unintended side effects such as taking longer to stop running, or continuing to run by itself after we close it. At the
end of the day, it is also running third-party plugins with Admin privileges, which can have risks. Whilst this is
exceedingly unlikely to occur, you can still choose to keep this setting disabled to prevent any workloads from being
run with Elevated Permissions. Please note however that depending on your hardware and how you run Salad, this may
reduce your potential earnings.
