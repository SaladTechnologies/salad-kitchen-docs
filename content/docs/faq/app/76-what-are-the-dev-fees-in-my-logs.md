# What Are The "Dev Fees?" In My Logs?

We know what you’re thinking, no - it’s not Salad’s “hidden fee.” Dev Fees represent the charges meted out by the third party pools we use, like Nicehash. We don’t control this fee, nor do we see a penny of the proceeds. It’s just the price we all pay for [mining pools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mining_pool).
