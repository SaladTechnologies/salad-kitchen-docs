# Why isn't Task Manager Showing any Activity for Salad

Task Manager inconsistently reports Saladâ€™s activity. This is due to how Task Manager displays GPU usage, and which stat to show. Often, Salad will be using other parts of your GPU that do not register in Task Manager without adjusting settings.

To monitor your GPU usage while running Salad, we recommend checking your Performance tab in the app. Here we'll display GPU/CPU usage. This should give you a much more accurate representation of how Salad is using your GPU.
