title: I've Received a Suspicious Login Attempt

_Last Updated: 23rd October 2025_

## Why Did I Receive a One-Time Login Code that I did not Request?

One of Salad's available login workflows is driven by a unique, one-time login code delivered by email. It's possible
that someone else typed in your email address by accident. When this happens, you'll receive an email from Salad with a
one-time login code.

## What Do I Do When I Receive a One-Time Login Code that I did not Request?

If you receive an email from Salad with a one-time login code that you didn't request, simply delete the email and
ignore the request. Without the one-time login code, nobody can gain access to your Salad account or your Salad Balance.

## How do I Ensure my Salad Account and Salad Balance are Secure?

Here are a few tips to safeguard your account:

- Never share your one-time login code with anyone. Salad will never ask you to share your one-time login code (not even
  with Salad Support staff).
- Never enter your one-time login code into a non-Salad app or website. (A domain ending in xyx.salad.com or
  xyz.salad.io is a Salad domain.)
- Never grant other people access to your email account.
- Always use a unique, long password for your email account.
- Use our [PassKey](/docs/guides/using-salad/501-salad-app-passkeys) login option to secure your Salad account. PassKeys
  are a more secure alternative to passwords and one-time login codes.
