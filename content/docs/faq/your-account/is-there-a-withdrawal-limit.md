title: Is There a Withdrawal Limit?
---

There is a maximum daily withdrawal limit of $1000 of Salad Balance per person. This will reset each day at midnight
UTC. Your withdrawal limit will not increase the next day if you spend under the $1000 cap on a certain day. For
example, if you spend only $200 in day 1, on day 2 you will still only have a maximum cap of $1000, instead of $1800.

This limit is applied to the cost of the reward on the storefront, not the value of the reward itself. This limit also
applies to all redemptions and purchases from Salad, including charity donations.
