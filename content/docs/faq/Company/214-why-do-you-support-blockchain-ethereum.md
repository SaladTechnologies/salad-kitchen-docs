# Why do you Support Blockchain?

When Salad first started, [Crypto mining](https://support.salad.com/article/77-what-is-my-machine-actually-mining)
provided a reliable means for us to put Chefs' GPUs to work and earn them Salad Balance, whilst we worked on bringing
our other earning methods online. We continue to offer this as an available job so you always have a baseline Chopping
rate with Salad.
