# What is Salad’s business model?

Like any good Salad, our business model has multiple layers that strengthen the whole. Also like any good Salad, none of these layers involve selling your data. Here’s how it works.

## Customers

SaladCloud offers cloud computing resources for a wide range of technology companies and organizations. Even if we charge a fraction of the [current cloud providers’](https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/cloud-computing-service-providers/) costs, these jobs earn both Salad and our users significantly more than the pennies per hour that mining generates. Of course, the availability of these jobs can fluctuate. So we will continue to offer [blockchain](https://support.salad.com/article/77-what-is-my-machine-actually-mining) networks as in addition to our Container and Bandwidth workloads to pad out Chefs' Salad earnings.

## Rewards

The rewards that Salad offers, like game codes, gift cards, and other items, are often acquired at discount/wholesale prices. While we do our best to pass on these savings, we do mark up the redemption price to earn a profit margin.
