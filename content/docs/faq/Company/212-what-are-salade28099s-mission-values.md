---

Salad Technologies’ mission is to be the easiest, safest, and most trusted way to share your compute. With a guiding
focus on trust, safety, and user-empathy, we hope to deliver great value to both gamers and clients starved for
affordable processing power.

To earn this trust, we’ve committed to maximum transparency. We also highly encourage our community to question Salad,
keep our feet to the fire, chefs. We like the kitchen hot. If you have any unanswered questions about our business
model, company culture, or data usage, please reach out to us via a
