# Is Salad a Mining Pool?

No, Salad is not itself a mining pool. Instead, we leverage multiple third-party mining pools to maximize your earnings for [Mining workloads](https://support.salad.com/article/77-what-is-my-machine-actually-mining). We currently use:

- Nicehash
- Prohashing

Building on existing mining pools helps us streamline the mining process to deliver tangible rewards without users having to worry about pools, servers, wallets, etc.
