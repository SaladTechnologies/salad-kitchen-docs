title: Does my Salad Balance Expire?
---

Your Salad balance is a valuable resource that allows you to earn epic loot from the Salad store. However, it's
essential to be aware that your balance comes with an expiration date. Donâ€™t worry! Keeping your balance is pretty
straight forward. Read on for more information.

Your Salad balance can expire if you haven't logged into Salad or performed any chopping activities for a continuous
12-month period. This means that if you take a year-long gap from Salad, you might risk losing your remaining balance.

## **Preventing Balance Expiration**

The good news is that you can easily prevent your balance from expiring. To do so, all you need to do is log into Salad
or chop any workload on the Salad app. Doing either will ensure your balance remains available for your use.

## **How Do I Know?**

To keep you informed and avoid any unexpected surprises, Salad will send you a notification email as your balance
approaches its expiration date. This email will be sent when you are 1 month away from expiry. It's a friendly reminder
that your balance's expiration date is approaching.

## **Avoiding Expiration**

To ensure your balance remains intact and available for use in the Salad store, we recommend logging in at least once a
year. This is a straightforward action to take, even if you're taking a break from chopping. It's a small effort that
goes a long way in protecting your balance.

## **Consequences of Inactivity**

If there's no activity during the 30-day window provided in the email, your balance will expire. This means your account
will be reduced to a balance of 0. We don't be able to restore this balance if you start using Salad again afterwards.
