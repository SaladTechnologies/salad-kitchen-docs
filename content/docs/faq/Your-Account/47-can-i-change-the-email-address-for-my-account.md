title: Can I Change the Email Address for my Account?
---

Unfortunately you are not able to change the email address connected to your Salad Account. If you are intending to move
to a new email address, we recommend spending the last of your Salad Balance and then sending a request to
[Salad Support](/docs/Guides/Your-PC/216-how-to-create-a-support-ticket) to delete your account. You can then create a
new one with your new email address.

We are unable to transfer any progress or information from old accounts.
