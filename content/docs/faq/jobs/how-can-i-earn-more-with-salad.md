title: How Can I Earn More with Salad?
---

There are a number of things you can do to optimize your setup with Salad to Chop more Salad Balance.

- Make sure you're running Salad as often as possible, especially while you're sleeping or away from your computer. To
  prevent lost earnings, change your [Sleep settings](/docs/guides/using-salad/how-to-disable-sleep-mode) in Salad so
  your machine won't automatically shut down.
- Enable more hardware in Salad, the more you enable, the more you can earn.
- Set your [Auto-Start](/docs/guides/using-salad/salad-app-settings#auto-start) delay to start after 1-min so that Salad
  can start chopping as soon as your computer goes idle.
- The more powerful your GPU or CPU, the faster you earn. If you upgrade your hardware or run Salad on multiple
  high-performance machines, you can significantly increase your earnings. NVIDIA GPUs in the 30 or 40 series with 12 GB
  of VRAM or above have more common jobs.
- Make sure to close background applications, as this can impact your earning rate.
- Participate in our [Discord](http://discord.gg/salad) contests. We often giveaway hearty helpings of Salad balance to
  the winners of these competitions, and we make sure they're structured so everyone gets a chance to compete! Join the
  server and check the #salad-events channel to see what the current contest is.
