title: 'Will Installing Updates Lose my Jobs?'
---

When you update your Salad application, any currently running jobs will be stopped. Once the update is complete, you can
start Chopping again and search for new jobs.

---

## **Why do I Not Keep my Jobs?**

When you started the update, and your existing jobs were stopped, they were automatically reallocated to another Chef.
We do this to ensure the network is running the jobs customers request. Our customers expect high uptime, and so we
can't leave jobs unallocated whilst machines update. Once you're updated and Chopping again, you'll be back in the queue
to receive new jobs.

## **Why am I Not Receiving Jobs?**

Because you're back in the queue, it may take a little while to receive new jobs. This is normal, and you should start
receiving jobs again soon when one becomes available. You haven't been penalized from updating, but rather you've been
placed back in the queue to receive jobs like any other Chef, and another Chef may have been allocated your previous
jobs.
