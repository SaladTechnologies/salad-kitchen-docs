title: Does My PC Support Virtualization?
---

_Last Updated: 23rd October 2025_

Many modern computers support virtualization, and enable these features by default. You may check whether these features
are supported on your machine as follows:

1. With your computer on, press **Ctrl + Alt + Del**.
2. Select **Task Manager** from the menu.
3. Click the **Performance** tab.
4. If necessary, click **CPU** from the column on the left.

5. Below the chart you should see an attribute labeled "Virtualization" that displays the current status of
   virtualization support as **Enabled** or **Disabled**.

If you do not see the "Virtualization" attribute listed in the information panel, it is likely that your hardware
configuration does not support virtualization.
