title: Do you Support MacOS and Linux?
---

## Windows

Salad is currently only supported on recent versions of Windows 10 and Windows 11 (and beta support for Linux).

---

## Linux

A Linux version of Salad is currently in Beta and is targeting Chefs who have dedicated Linux boxes they want to run
Salad as it runs it natively on the machine. We are still evaluating the best course for running on a personal gaming
machine.

---

## MacOS

We have no plans to support MacOS.
