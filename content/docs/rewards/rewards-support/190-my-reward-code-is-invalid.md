# My Reward Code is Invalid

If a reward you have purchased is showing as invalid, there are a few things you can double check.

- Make sure you are redeeming it in the right place. The correct storefront, app section, or website, will be listed in
  the product name or description. If you are having trouble redeeming your item, make sure to check where it is valid
  for.
- Make sure you are in the correct region. Some keys are region locked, and will only work in certain locations. The
  [correct region](https://support.salad.com/article/243-what-region-is-this-reward-for) will be listed in the product
  title or description, make sure to double check where your key is valid for.
- You may have typed your key in wrong, make sure to double check it, or copy paste it if you aren't sure.
- If you have purchased DLC, you need to own the base game already to activate it.

If your reward is still showing as invalid when entered in the correct location in the correct region, there may be an
issue with the key we delivered. Please contact
