title: I Want a Refund
---

_Last Updated: 23rd October 2025_

Unfortunately, we do not offer refunds or exchanges for keys. As stated on our checkout window:

\- Salad plays for keeps, no refunds

Your rewards are sent via digital delivery, this means there is no way to 'return' your key, or for us to invalidate the
key. Because of this, we have to operate under a No Refunds policy and we can't offer you your Salad Balance back.

If you are having an issue activating your key, please check this
[FAQ](/docs/rewards/rewards-support/my-reward-code-is-invalid) or contact [Salad Support](/contact) and we can do our
best to assist you.
