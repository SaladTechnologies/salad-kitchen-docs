# Redeem a Cybrancee Web Hosting Plan

## **How Do I Redeem Cybrancee Rewards?**

Once you have purchased a Cybrancee voucher from the Salad Storefront, you'll receive an activation code that can be
redeemed for a Cybrancee service plan.
([How do I find my activation code?](https://support.salad.com/article/125-where-to-find-your-reward-redemption-code))

If you need help beyond what is supplied in this guide page, please refer to Cybrancee's official help center,
[here](https://cybrancee.com/learn/).

_Please note: In order to manage your Cybrancee service plan, you will need to create a free account at_
[_cybrancee.com_](https://cybrancee.com/)_. Because new account creations are subject to a manual review period, your
subscription will activate once the Cybrancee team has approved your request._
