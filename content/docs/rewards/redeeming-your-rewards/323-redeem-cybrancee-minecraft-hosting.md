# Redeem Cybrancee Minecraft Hosting

## **How Do I Redeem Cybrancee Rewards?**

Once you have purchased a Cybrancee voucher from the Salad Storefront, you'll receive an activation code that can be redeemed for a Cybrancee service plan. ([How do I find my activation code?](https://support.salad.com/article/125-where-to-find-your-reward-redemption-code))

If you need help beyond what is supplied in this guide page, please refer to Cybrancee's official help center, [here](https://cybrancee.com/learn/).

*Please note: In order to manage your Cybrancee service plan, you will need to create a free account at* [*cybrancee.com*](https://cybrancee.com/)*. Because new account creations are subject to a manual review period, your subscription will activate once the Cybrancee team has approved your request.*
