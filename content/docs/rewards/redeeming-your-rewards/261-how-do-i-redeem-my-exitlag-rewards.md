2. You will receive an email—at the address you provided when creating your account—asking you to confirm your account.
   Use the link to confirm your account.
3. Log into your account at [https://www.exitlag.com/en/](https://www.exitlag.com/en/).
4. Navigate to and click on “My Account” in the top right corner of ExitLag’s website.
5. Click on “Prepaid codes” on the left-hand side navigation bar.
6. Enter the code you received from Salad in the field that says “Prepaid Code” and then click “Apply Code”.
