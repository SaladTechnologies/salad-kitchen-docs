# How Do I Redeem My CMC Minecraft Rewards?

Redeeming keys (aka coupons) is actually quite simple. CMC reward keys are redeemed on CMC’s website.

## CMC Cosmetic Redemption

1. If you do not have a CMClient account, go to [https://cm-pack.pl/panel/sign-up.php](https://cm-pack.pl/panel/sign-up.php) and create an account with the same nickname you use in Minecraft.
2. If you already have an account, go to the login page on [https://cm-pack.pl/panel/sign-in.php](https://cm-pack.pl/panel/sign-in.php) and log in using your email or nickname and password.
3. Go to the “Activate Code” page [https://cm-pack.pl/panel/activate.php](https://cm-pack.pl/panel/activate.php) enter the key you received from Salad in the field “Activation Code” and click “Activate”.
4. Add the cosmetic to your nickname on the “Cosmetics” page [https://cm-pack.pl/panel/cosmetic](https://cm-pack.pl/panel/cosmetics.php).
